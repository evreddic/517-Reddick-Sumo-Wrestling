## [What is Sumo?](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2080.html)
Sumo is a full contact sport where two competitors try to force one another out of a circle ring through a variety of pulling and pushing strategies. The first person to be pushed out of the circuluar space is the loser. The match takes place on a elevated ring surface called a **Dohyo** and the competitors often fall off of it during the conclusion of the match due to the forceful nature of the sport. There is another person within the ring called the **Gyoji** or the referee of the match who determines who crossed over the circular boundry and into the outside area of the Dohyo. The Gyoji serve [another purpose](https://sumowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Gyoji#:~:text=He%20will%20sometimes%20add%2C%20%22kamaete,after%20a%20good%20tachi%2Dai.) however, they also yell at the competitors throughout the match to motivate them to fight or continue to fight if there is a stalemate. 

**Here is some helpful vocabulary to know when watching sumo:**
 * _Banzuke_- A list of all participating wrestlers in the tournament
 * _Rikishi_- A title that sumo wrestlers are called no matter rank
 * _Chumoku-ichiban_- The most anticipated match of the day
 * _Dohyo-iri_- The ring entering ceremony at the start of the tournament day

### Cultural Signifigance 
The sport of sumo originated from the country of Japan and has been a active sport since the Kofun Period (300-538). The sport combines concepts of Japanese culture, tradition, and spiritualism with many stemming from [Shintoism](https://www.greenshinto.com/sumos-shinto-spirit/).

>**Sumo was originally performed in the Shinto (Japanese ethnic religion) rituals of purification and prayers for a good harvest.** -from [Toki](https://www.toki.tokyo/blogt/2017/6/21/sumo-national-sport#:~:text=Sumo%20was%20originally%20performed%20in,a%20form%20of%20public%20entertainment.)

Sumo is the national sport of Japan and continues to bring enourmous crowds for matches through the year which are held in tournament fashion throughout major Japanese cities such as Kyoto. 


### Ranking System
Since sumo is played in a tournament fashion this allows for a flexibile and ever changing ranking system to be implemented based on the win/loss ratio of each sumo wrestler. The top division of sumo is called **Makunouchi**. This is where the best competitors are placed and some even have named rankings such as **Yokozuna**, the title given to the best wrestler. There are other divisions under Makunouchi but for now lets look at a breakdown of ranks within the Makunouchi division.
